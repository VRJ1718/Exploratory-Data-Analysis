# 🏏 IPL 2025 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This repository presents a complete Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the **Indian Premier League (IPL) 2025** season using Python and Pandas. The analysis dives deep into match-level and ball-by-ball data to uncover trends, top performers, and team strategies throughout the tournament.

## 📂 Dataset

The analysis is based on the following CSV files:

- `matches.csv` – Match-level information
- `deliveries.csv` – Ball-by-ball breakdown
- `orange_cap.csv` – Top run scorers per match
- `purple_cap.csv` – Top wicket takers per match

## 🔍 Key Analyses

1. **Top 10 Run Scorers** – Identify the Orange Cap contenders  
2. **Top 10 Wicket Takers** – Explore the Purple Cap leaderboard  
3. **Most Sixes & Fours by Players** – Boundary hitters leaderboard  
4. **Team-wise Total Runs** – Batting strength across teams  
5. **Top 10 Highest Innings Totals** – Most dominant team innings  
6. **Most Economical Bowlers (Min. 5 Overs)** – Consistent run savers  
7. **Total Runs per Over (1–20)** – Over-by-over scoring breakdown  
8. **Dismissal Types Breakdown** – Modes of dismissals distribution  
9. **Toss Decision Impact** – Outcome analysis: Bat or Bowl first?  
10. **Match Result Summary** – Wins by runs vs wins by wickets

## 📊 Tools & Technologies Used

- **Python** – Core scripting language  
- **Pandas** – Data wrangling and transformation  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Visualizations  
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Interactive analysis environment

---

## 📌 Key Takeaways

- Death overs (16–20) contributed heavily to total scores — but also revealed the most economical bowlers.
- Several teams opted to chase after winning the toss — but success was not guaranteed.
- Dismissals like *Caught* and *Bowled* remained the most common, while *Run Outs* and *LBW* were more situational.
